A package provided by: Impect GmbH

Updated: April 17th 2023

The goal of the impectR package is to provide an easy way for Impect Customers
to access data from the customer API. This API includes basic information about
competitions, competition iterations, and matches as well as event data and
aggregated scorings per player and position on match level.

## Installation

You can install the developmental version of impectR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ImpectAPI/impectR")
```

## Getting started

Before accessing any data via our API, you will need to request a bearer token
for authorization. You can get this authorization token using the following code
snippet:

```{r accessToken, eval=FALSE}
library(impectR)

# define login credentials
username <- "yourUsername"
password <- "yourPassword"

# get access token
token <- getAccessToken(username = username, password = password)
```

This access token is a requirement to use any of the functions that requests
data from the API. We recommend to first get a list of competition iterations
that are enabled for your account.

```{r competition iterations, eval=FALSE}
# get list of competition iterations
competitions <- getCompetitions(token = token)

# print competition iterations to console
competitions
```

If any competition iteration you were expected to see is not listed, please
contact your sales representative. Now let's assume you are interested in data
for 2022/23 season of the 1. Bundesliga (competitionIteration = 518). The
following snippet gets you a list of matches for this competition and season:

``` {r match plan, eval=FALSE}
# get match plan for competition iteration
matchplan <-
  getMatchplan(competitionIterationId = 518, token = token)

# print match to console
matchplan
```

The column `available` denotes whether a given match has been tagged by Impect
and the data is available to you. Let's assume you are interested in the FC
Bayern MÃ¼nchen vs Borussia Dortmund game from April 1st 2023 (matchId = 84344).
To request the event data for this game, run the following code snippet:

```{r events, eval=FALSE}
# define match ID
matchId <- 84344

# get event data for match
events <- getEventData(match = matchId, token = token)

# print first few rows from events dataframe to console
head(events)
```

You can access the aggregated scores per player and position for this match in
a similar way:

```{r matchsums, eval=FALSE}
# define match ID
matchId <- 84344

# get matchsums for match
matchsums <- getMatchsums(match = matchId, token = token)

# print first few rows from matchsums dataframe to console
head(matchsums)
```

In case you wish to retrieve data for multiple matches, we suggest using the
following method to do so. Let's also get the event data for the RB Leipzig vs
FSV Mainz 05 game (matchId = 84350) from the same day:

```{r multiple matches, eval=FALSE}
# define list of matches
matches <- c(84344, 84350)

# apply getEventData function to a set of matchIds
events <-
  purrr::map_df(purrr::map(match_ids, ~ getEventData(match = ., token = token)),
                as.data.frame)

# apply getMatchsums function to a set of matchIds
matchsums <-
  purrr::map_df(purrr::map(match_ids, ~ getMatchsums(match = ., token = token)),
                as.data.frame)

```

Please keep in mind that Impect enforces a rate limit of 8 requests per second
per user. As the function usually runs for about 2 seconds, there shouldn't be
any issues but it might be a potential issue.

## Final Notes

Further documentation on the data and explanations of variables can be found in our [glossary](https://glossary.impect.com/).
